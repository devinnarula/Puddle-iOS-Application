### Have you ever wanted to know more about your college campus?

### Well, now you can! With puddle, you can be the first to know about obstacles on campus. 
### Our app allows you to place icons of puddles, construction, and crowds on a map when you run into them. 
### As you walk around campus, you will see yourself on the map, as well as markers that have been placed around campus by other students like you.
